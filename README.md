# Fleeting Notes

**Work In Progress**: Side project with little time associated to it.

Obsidian does not offer a good integration for fleeting notes. Thats where this
plugin aims to step in.

### What are fleeting notes?

Fleeting notes are the quick notes you take whenever a idea pops into mind, you
have a discussion and write down your notes, etc. All the notes that are perfect
for short memory aid but are not intended to be used as a permanent note. They
need to be worked over and integrated into existing permanent notes or
eventually creating new permanent notes. This should happen in quick succession
to the taking of the fleeting note, ideally the same day.

### What tries this plugin to solve?

- I want my fleeting notes to have no intentional file name, i.e. randomly
  generated.
- I want a quick command to add a new fleeting note. I want all of the notes
  stored in a separate folder.
- I want to have a picked list of fleeting notes which can be searched, if
  they are not processed.
- I want to be able to clean fleeting notes when they are processed or not
  worked on for period of time.

#### Why do I want random file names?

Often when faced with quickly writing down an idea, you get blocked by first
thinking about a title for that specific note. For the purpose of fleeting notes
it is much more important to instantly write down your brain process and not be
hindered by thinking of a title that encapsulates the thought. The latter is
better thought of after writing the note. You can rename the file, but just
giving it a `h1` title should be sufficient. Also make sure to pack your title
to be able to identify the note later.
